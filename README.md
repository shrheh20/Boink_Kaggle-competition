# Boink_Kaggle-competition
This competition was conducted by Tinkerers codecell VESIT in collaboration with Kaggle. We had to explore various methods of data preprocessing and regression techniques.

The problem statement was to predict the employee attrition probablity and the number of years the employee would stay at the company.

Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree were used for data modeling purposes.
we would like to thank Codecell VESIT for conducting this hackathon. We learnt a great deal of machine learning under time constraints and strived to achieve maximum accuracy.
